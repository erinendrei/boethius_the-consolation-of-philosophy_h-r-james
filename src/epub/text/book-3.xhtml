				</hgroup>
				<p epub:type="bridgehead"><abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>. Boethius beseeches Philosophy to continue. She promises to lead him to true happiness.⁠—<abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. Happiness is the one end which all created beings seek. They aim variously at (a) wealth, or (b) rank, or (c) sovereignty, or (d) glory, or (e) pleasure, because they think thereby to attain either (a) contentment, (b) reverence, (c) power, (d) renown, or (e) gladness of heart, in one or other of which they severally imagine happiness to consist.⁠—<abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. Philosophy proceeds to consider whether happiness can really be secured in any of these ways, (a) So far from bringing contentment, riches only add to men’s wants.⁠—<abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>. (b) High position cannot of itself win respect. Titles command no reverence in distant and barbarous lands. They even fall into contempt through lapse of time.⁠—<abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span>. (c) Sovereignty cannot even bestow safety. History tells of the downfall of kings and their ministers. Tyrants go in fear of their lives.⁠—<abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span>. (d) Fame conferred on the unworthy is but disgrace. The splendour of noble birth is not a man’s own, but his ancestors’.⁠—<abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>. (e) Pleasure begins in the restlessness of desire, and ends in repentance. Even the pure pleasures of home may turn to gall and bitterness.⁠—<abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span>. All fail, then, to give what they promise. There is, moreover, some accompanying evil involved in each of these aims. Beauty and bodily strength are likewise of little worth. In strength man is surpassed by the brutes; beauty is but outward show.⁠—<abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span>. The source of men’s error in following these phantoms of good is that <em>they break up and separate that which is in its nature one and indivisible</em>. Contentment, power, reverence, renown, and joy are essentially bound up one with the other, and, if they are to be attained at all, must be attained <em>together</em>. True happiness, if it can be found, will include them all. But it cannot be found among the perishable things hitherto considered.⁠—<abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span>. Such a happiness necessarily exists. Its seat is in God. Nay, God is very happiness, and in a manner, therefore, the happy man partakes also of the Divine nature. All other ends are relative to this good, since they are all pursued only for the sake of good; it is <em>good</em> which is the sole ultimate end. And since the sole end is also happiness, it is plain that this good and happiness are in essence the same.⁠—<abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span>. Unity is another aspect of goodness. Now, all things subsist so long only as they preserve the unity of their being; when they lose this unity, they perish. But the bent of nature forces all things (plants and inanimate things, as well as animals) to strive to continue in life. Therefore, all things desire unity, for unity is essential to life. But unity and goodness were shown to be the same. Therefore, good is proved to be the end towards which the whole universe tends.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11" id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">11</a>⁠—<abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span>. Boethius acknowledges that he is but recollecting truths he once knew. Philosophy goes on to show that it is goodness also by which the whole world is governed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a> Boethius professes compunction for his former folly. But the paradox of evil is introduced, and he is once more perplexed.</p>
